# 📱 iOS Login Page (Swift + Storyboard)

This project implements a **login screen** for an iOS application based on the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/JiU14P3xdnJKrtn6IUe9IS/Login?type=design&node-id=0:1&mode=design&t=2dCkfX1Ar81Vnvuw-1).  
It focuses on building a **responsive and adaptive UI** using **AutoLayout**, ensuring a consistent look across different iPhone screen sizes.  

At this stage, the app is **UI-only**:  
- User input from `UITextField` is printed in the **Xcode console**.  
- No navigation or authentication logic is implemented yet.
